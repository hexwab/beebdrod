With an accompaniment of ten soldiers, Beethro made his way to a large, metal door, covered from top to bottom with locks, bolts, and chains.  He unlocked and opened the door with a ring of keys handed to him.  The soldiers shrunk back, swords drawn, as the door creaked open to reveal a descending staircase.  Far down below, he could see oily, black cockroaches skittering about.

"Those cockroaches are as big as I am!" he exclaimed.

"Just get down there!" said the King and some of the soldiers forcefully helped Beethro through the doorway.  The door slammed shut behind him and the locks were rapidly put back on.  He heard a muffled yell from the other side.

"Don't come back until you're done!"
