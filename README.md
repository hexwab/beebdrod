BBC Micro port of DROD.

Specifically Caravel DROD (v1.6), which is under MPL and can be found here: http://www.caravelgames.com/Articles/Games_2/AE.html .  Source is at https://github.com/binji/drod/tree/master/Caravel .  

(The official DROD repo, for newer games with engine versions >=2.0, is at https://github.com/EvidentlyCube/drod and is probably more easily buildable.  But as a reference it's less good as there's around 3x the code, none of which is required for KDD.)

Requirements: Master or Model B/B+ with DFS and SRUTILS and SWRAM in bank 4 (for now)

Keys:
* hjklyubn (nethack-style) or numpad (on Master): move
* qw: turn sword
* m: map
* r: restart room

Debugging keys:
* cursors: move by an entire room
